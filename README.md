# Google Gemma 3 AI – Comprehensive Developer’s Tutorial and Guide 

Welcome back, AI enthusiasts! Today, we’re exploring **Google’s new Gemma 3 AI** — a powerful open-source model designed to operate on a single GPU. If you’ve heard the hype about Gemma 3 being the “most powerful model you can use on one GPU,” you’re in the right place.

## About Gemma 3

### What is Google Gemma 3?

Think of [Gemma 3](https://ai.google.dev/gemma) as Google’s answer to GPT-style models, but it’s **open** and optimized to run anywhere — your laptop, a single server, or even a high-end phone! It’s the latest in Google’s Gemma family of AI models. Google took the same core tech that powers their gigantic Gemini models and distilled it into Gemma 3. The result: a set of models you can actually download and run yourself. Gemma 3 is all about accessibility without sacrificing performance. In fact, the largest Gemma 3 model, with 27 billion parameters, ranks among the top open AI models in quality.

### Understanding Gemma 3 Models

Gemma 3 comes in four sizes — 1B, 4B, 12B, and 27B (that’s “B” for billion parameters). The bigger, the smarter, generally. But even the 4B or 12B can handle a lot. It’s multilingual (140+ languages out of the box) and even multimodal, meaning it can understand images combined with text. We’ve only seen this in very advanced models like GPT-4. Plus, Gemma 3 has an expanded memory — a 128,000 token context window — basically, it can read and remember extremely long documents or conversations. For perspective, that’s over 100 pages of text in one go!

Google made **Gemma 3 open for developers**. You can download the model weights for free and run them locally or call Gemma 3 through an API. There is no need to pay per prompt if you host it yourself. It’s licensed for commercial use with some responsible AI guidelines, so you could potentially build it into a product. This open-model approach is similar to Meta’s LLaMA 2, but Google’s taken it further with multimodal and high efficiency.

You can use your favorite tools, such as **Hugging Face Transformers, Ollama, PyTorch, Google AI Edge, UnSloth, vLLM, etc**. In this tutorial, I’ll show you how to use it via Hugging Face. At the end of my tutorial, we’ll have a web application similar to ChatGPT that we will run locally.

### Gemma 3’s Key Features

![Gemma 3’s Key Features](https://proflead.dev/assets/blog/gemma-3-full-guide/3.webp)



- **Small but Strong.** Gemma 3 is powerful; even the big 27B model can run on one GPU. It’s faster and smaller than many other AIs.
- **It Reads Long Texts.** It can read and understand very long documents, such as books or contracts, all at once.
- **Understands Pictures and Text.** You can show it an image and ask questions. It knows how to look at pictures and give competent answers.
- **Speaks 140+ Languages.** Gemma works in many languages — like Spanish, French, Japanese, and more.
- **Gives Clean Data.** It can reply in formats like JSON, so developers can use the answers in apps easily.
- **Runs on Smaller Devices.** Smaller versions are available, so you can run it on laptops with less memory.
- **Built-in Safety.** Google added ShieldGemma 2 tools to help keep it safe and block harmful content.

### How to Use Gemma 3 with Hugging Face Transformers (Python)

If you’re comfortable with Python, this is straightforward. Hugging Face has the Gemma 3 models on their hub. All you do is install transformers library, and then download the model. I won’t explain all the steps in detail, but you can read my [full tutorial about Hugging Face](https://proflead.dev/posts/hugging-face-tutorial/),

Before we start, you would need:

- Install IDE like [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Install Python language

Then follow these steps:

- Open: [https://huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co/) and create an account there.
- Click the “Models” lin in the top nav and filter the result by typing “Gemma” and after select on of the Google’s model from the list.

![How to Use Gemma 3 with Hugging Face Transformers (Python)](https://proflead.dev/assets/blog/gemma-3-full-guide/6.webp)



- Select the desired model, e.g., [https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-3-4b-it,](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-3-4b-it) and accept the license agreement.

![Select the desired model and accept the license agreement](https://proflead.dev/assets/blog/gemma-3-full-guide/7.webp)



Then open your terminal and paste these commands one by one:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv  
source venv/bin/activate  
pip install transformers datasets evaluate accelerate  
pip install torch
```

Then open your IDE and create a new file, e.g., `main.py`, with the following code:

```python
from transformers import pipeline  
import torch  
  
pipe = pipeline(  
    "image-text-to-text",  
    model="google/gemma-3-4b-it",  
    device="cpu",  
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16  
)  
  
messages = [  
    {  
        "role": "system",  
        "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "You are a helpful assistant."}]  
    },  
    {  
        "role": "user",  
        "content": [  
            {"type": "image", "url": "https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/p-blog/candy.JPG"},  
            {"type": "text", "text": "What animal is on the candy?"}  
        ]  
    }  
]  
  
output = pipe(text=messages, max_new_tokens=200)  
print(output[0]["generated_text"][-1]["content"])
```

Run the python code by using this command:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

In this example, we asked Gemma to look at the image from the URL and identify the animal on the candy. We used the Gemma 3–4B model and the device — CPU.

The complete code with other examples you can find on my Git repo — [Gemma 3](https://github.com/proflead/gemma-3-tutorial)

### How to Use Gemma 3 via Google’s API

As in the Hugging Face example, before we start, you would need:

- Install IDE like [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Install Python language

Then follow these steps:

- Open [https://aistudio.google.com/](https://aistudio.google.com/) and create a Google account if you don’t have one.
- Then click on the “Get API key” button. On this page, you need to generate an API key. We will need it to connect to Google Cloud API.

![How to Use Gemma 3 via Google’s API](https://proflead.dev/assets/blog/gemma-3-full-guide/8.webp)

Then open your terminal and paste these commands one by one:

```bash
pip install google-generativeai  
pip install google-genai
```

Then open your IDE and create a new file, e.g., google-cloud-api-terminal.py, with the following code:

```python
import google.generativeai as genai  
  
# Configure the API key  
genai.configure(api_key="[REPLACE-THIS-TEXT-WITH-YOUR-API-KEY]")  
  
# Initialize the GenerativeModel with the model name as a positional argument  
model = genai.GenerativeModel("gemma-3-27b-it")  
  
# Generate content  
response = model.generate_content("What is the latest version of iphone?")  
  
# Print the generated text  
print(response.text)
```

This example used a 27-billion parameters model and a simple text prompt.

The complete code with other examples you can find on my Git repo — [Gemma 3](https://github.com/proflead/gemma-3-tutorial)

## A Simple Web Application Similar To ChatGPT that Using Gemma 3

So, let’s collect everything together and create a simple web application that we can run locally on your computer. In this example, I’ll be using Google Cloud API but you can use Hugging Face and download the model on your computer.

We are going to use the **chainlit library**. Chainlit is an open-source Python package to build production-ready Conversational AI.

Before we start, you would need:

- Install IDE like [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Install Python language
- Google’s API key from Google AI studio (look at the previous section).

Then open your terminal and paste these commands one by one:

```bash
pip install google-generativeai  
pip install google-genai  
pip install chainlit
```

Then open your IDE and create a new file, e.g., google-cloud-web-interface.py, with the following code:

```python
import chainlit as cl  
import google.generativeai as genai  
  
# Configure the Generative AI client  
genai.configure(api_key="[REPLACE-THIS-TEXT-WITH-YOUR-API-KEY]")  
  
# Initialize the GenerativeModel  
model = genai.GenerativeModel("gemma-3-27b-it")  
  
@cl.on_message  
async def handle_message(message: cl.Message):  
    # Generate content based on the user's input  
    response = model.generate_content(contents=[message.content])  
    reply = response.text  
    # Send the generated response back to the user  
    await cl.Message(content=reply).send()
```

Run the Python code by using this command:

```bash
chainlit run google-cloud-web-interface.py
```

If everything is ok, you will see your web application at http://localhost:8000/
